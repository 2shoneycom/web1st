        <h1>HTML 이란?</h1>
        <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/defaults.asp" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup Language</a> 
        or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed 
        to be displayed in a web browser.</strong> It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
        <strong>It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (<u>CSS</u>) and scripting 
        languages such as JavaScript. </strong>

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or 
            from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the 
            structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
